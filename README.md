# neutronAttenuationMonteCarlo
Simulates neutron attenuation through different materials
 
 Finds the attenuation length of neutrons for water, graphite and lead
 sheilding materials. Also computes the probabilities of transmission,
 absorbtion, transmission of neutrons for set lengths of sheilding
 material
